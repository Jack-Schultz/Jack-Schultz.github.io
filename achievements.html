                    <h3>Clarnette Family Ethics Prize - 2023</h3>
                    <!--  <img src="images/tetris.png" alt="Screenshot of Tetris game"> -->
                    <p>
                        I was honoured to receive this annual prize in recognition of my outstanding contribution to
                        the ethical awareness of the College community. The award highlights my ability to apply
                        ethical analysis and demonstrate ethical leadership, advocacy, and service, both on
                        campus and within the broader community. This recognition was especially meaningful because
                        it was voted on by the College’s teachers, reflecting the trust and respect I’ve earned
                        from academic professionals.
                        <br><br>
                        This achievement is significant because it provides evidence of my ability to:

                    <ul>
                        Demonstrate Ethical Leadership: By consistently acting with integrity and
                        promoting ethical standards, I contributed to creating a more thoughtful, conscientious
                        community. This is an important skill in any professional setting, as ethical leadership
                        underpins effective decision-making and fosters a culture of trust.
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        Engage in Ethical Analysis: I have shown strong critical thinking skills in
                        addressing complex ethical dilemmas. This ability to analyse situations from a moral perspective
                        is crucial in identifying the right course of action, especially in roles that require
                        accountability, compliance, and social responsibility.
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        Influence and Inspire Others: Through advocacy and service, I’ve played an
                        active role in encouraging others to reflect on ethical issues and improve their conduct.
                        This ability to inspire and guide people towards better choices is an asset in leadership or
                        team-based roles.
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        Build Trust and Respect: Being selected by my teachers for this award speaks
                        to the consistent and positive impression I’ve made, further validating my commitment to ethical
                        principles.
